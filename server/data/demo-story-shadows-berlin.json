Born to a Russian defector mother and British father, she speaks fluent Russian, Czech, and German. Recruited to MI6 at Cambridge by Sir Geoffrey Hastings, she's known for her analytical mind and ability to operate independently. Her mixed heritage gives her unique insight into Russian intelligence methods but also makes her suspect in some circles. Highly skilled in tradecraft, firearms, and hand-to-hand combat. Has trust issues stemming from her mother's defection and subsequent paranoia.",

A Chinese MSS operation would be more contemporary and less expected.\n\n2. **The mole is at the very top**: Instead of mid-level bureaucrat, what if it's someone like the Deputy Director? Someone who recruited your protagonist?\n\n3. **Post-Cold War setting with Cold War ghosts**: Use Berlin, Prague, Moscow—places with espionage history but modern complications.\n\n4. **Give your protagonist mixed heritage**: British-Russian background could provide both skills and complications.\n\n5. **Make trust the central theme**: If the institution is compromised from the top, who can she trust? Going rogue becomes not rebellion but necessity.\n\nWould you like to develop any of these elements further?",

Initial evidence points to her handler—someone she trusts—which makes her question everything.\n\n**Act 2 - Prague**: She goes off-grid to consult a former mentor (perhaps from the other side, retired Russian intelligence). He reveals it's bigger than she thought—not just her handler, but someone higher. He gives her one name: a defector in Moscow who knows the full picture.\n\n**Act 3 - Moscow**: Extreme risk. The defector reveals the shocking truth (the Deputy Director), but gets killed for it. Now she has the information but no way to safely deliver it through her own compromised agency.\n\nEach piece of information costs something—a contact dies, she burns her career, she risks her life. Nothing comes easy, and the stakes escalate with each revelation.",
