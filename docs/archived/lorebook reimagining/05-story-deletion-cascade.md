# Task 05: Story Deletion - Lorebook Cascade

## Objective
Update story DELETE endpoint to properly clean up story-level lorebook entries.

## Context
- No FK cascade from stories to lorebookEntries (application handles deletion)
- Must manually delete story-level entries before deleting story
- Other story relations (chapters, aiChats, etc.) cascade via existing FK constraints

## Dependencies
- **Task 01**: Database schema with level/scopeId
- **Task 02**: Updated types

## File Locations
- **Modify**: `server/routes/stories.ts`

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Story DELETE Endpoint
Modify existing `DELETE /stories/:id` in `server/routes/stories.ts`:

```typescript
import { lorebookEntries } from '../db/schema.js';

// DELETE /stories/:id - Delete story with lorebook cascade
storiesRouter.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const storyId = req.params.id;

        // 1. Delete all story-level lorebook entries
        await db.delete(lorebookEntries).where(
            and(
                eq(lorebookEntries.level, 'story'),
                eq(lorebookEntries.scopeId, storyId)
            )
        );

        // 2. Delete the story (FK cascades handle chapters, aiChats, notes, etc.)
        await db.delete(stories).where(eq(stories.id, storyId));

        res.status(204).send();
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete story' });
    }
});
```

### 2. Add Transaction Support (Optional but Recommended)
Wrap deletion in transaction to ensure atomicity:

```typescript
storiesRouter.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const storyId = req.params.id;

        await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
            // 1. Delete story-level lorebook entries
            await tx.delete(lorebookEntries).where(
                and(
                    eq(lorebookEntries.level, 'story'),
                    eq(lorebookEntries.scopeId, storyId)
                )
            );

            // 2. Delete story
            await tx.delete(stories).where(eq(stories.id, storyId));
        });

        res.status(204).send();
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete story' });
    }
});
```

### 3. Consider Bulk Delete (if exists)
If there's a bulk delete endpoint, apply same logic to each story ID.

## Cascade Behavior Summary

**Story deletion cascades:**
- ✅ Chapters (FK: `chapters.storyId → stories.id`)
- ✅ AI Chats (FK: `aiChats.storyId → stories.id`)
- ✅ Notes (FK: `notes.storyId → stories.id`)
- ✅ Scene Beats (FK via chapters)
- ✅ Story-level lorebook entries (application-level cascade in this task)

**Story deletion does NOT cascade:**
- Series membership (story.seriesId set to null when series deleted)

## Validation
- Create test story with multiple lorebook entries
- Delete story via API
- Verify:
  - Story deleted successfully
  - All story-level lorebook entries removed
  - Chapters, notes, aiChats also removed (existing FK behavior)
  - Global and series entries unaffected
- Test rollback: simulate database error mid-delete, verify nothing partially deleted (if using transactions)

## Notes
- **Critical**: Without this change, story deletion orphans lorebook entries
- Transaction support prevents partial deletion on errors
- Phase 1 maintains storyId field, so existing queries still work during migration
