# Lorebook Hierarchy Implementation - Task Overview

## Purpose
This directory contains individual implementation plans for adding three-tier lorebook hierarchy (Global/Series/Story) to The Story Nexus application.

## Implementation Strategy

### Two-Phase Approach
1. **Phase 1 (Tasks 01-15)**: Add new hierarchy fields while keeping `storyId` for backward compatibility
2. **Phase 2 (Task 16)**: Remove `storyId` field after Phase 1 is stable and verified

This approach minimizes risk and allows rollback if issues are discovered.

  - Remove storyId from schema
  - Generate migration (table recreation)
  - Update types
  - Clean up temporary assignments
  - Dependencies: Tasks 01-15 completed and verified in production

## Critical Tasks

These tasks are **critical** for functionality and must be done correctly:

1. **Task 01** - Database migration must preserve all existing data
2. **Task 04** - Hierarchical endpoint is used by all AI features
3. **Task 08** - Hierarchical query hook connects UI to AI context
4. **Task 13** - Prompt parser must use hierarchical entries or AI context will be incomplete

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Backend
1. Task 01 - Database Schema Phase 1
2. Task 02 - Types
3. Task 03 - Series Routes
4. Task 04 - Lorebook Routes (includes critical hierarchical endpoint)
5. Task 05 - Story Deletion Cascade

### Sprint 2: Frontend State & API
6. Task 06 - API Client
7. Task 07 - Series Query Hooks
8. Task 08 - Lorebook Query Hooks

### Sprint 3: UI Components
9. Task 09 - Series UI
10. Task 10 - Global Lorebook UI
11. Task 11 - Story Lorebook Inheritance
12. Task 12 - Story Form Series Selection

### Sprint 4: Services & Integration
13. Task 15 - Filter Service (lightweight, can be done anytime)
14. Task 13 - Prompt Parser (critical, needs testing)
15. Task 14 - Import/Export

### Sprint 5 (Later): Cleanup
16. Task 16 - Phase 2 (only after 2+ weeks of stable Phase 1)

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Task
- Unit tests for new functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Manual testing of related UI

### After Sprint 1 (Backend Complete)
- Test all CRUD operations via REST client
- Verify cascade deletion
- Verify hierarchical query returns correct data

### After Sprint 2 (State Management Complete)
- Test query hooks return correct data
- Test mutations trigger correct cache invalidations
- Test optimistic updates

### After Sprint 3 (UI Complete)
- Full user workflow testing
- Create global/series/story entries
- Verify inheritance display
- Test series assignment

### After Sprint 4 (Integration Complete)
- **CRITICAL**: Test AI features with hierarchical context
- Test scene beat generation with global character
- Test continue writing with series location
- Test import/export round-trip

### Before Phase 2
- Full regression test of all features
- Production soak test (2+ weeks minimum)
- Database backup verification

## Rollback Plan

### Phase 1 Issues
If issues found during Phase 1:
- All queries work with both storyId and level/scopeId during Phase 1
- Can fix bugs without rollback
- storyId field preserved for safety

### Phase 2 Issues
If issues found after Phase 2 migration:
1. Stop application
2. Restore database backup (made before Phase 2)
3. Revert code to Phase 1 version
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Retry Phase 2 when ready

- [ ] Story lorebook shows inherited entries
- [ ] AI context includes global/series entries
- [ ] Import/export works with new formats

- [ ] All features still work
- [ ] Production stable for 1+ month

## Notes

- Each task is designed to be given to an implementation agent
- Tasks include detailed code examples and validation steps
- Dependencies clearly marked - don't start dependent tasks early
- Critical tasks marked - pay extra attention to these
- Two-phase approach minimizes risk of data corruption
- Phase 2 is optional cleanup - system fully functional after Phase 1
